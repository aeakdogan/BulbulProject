Known for iconic rock hits such as the number ones \"We're An American Band\" and  \"The Loco-Motion\", the band initially consisted of Mark Farner (vocals, guitar), Mel Schacher (bass) and Don Brewer (drums), with Craig Frost (keyboards) joining in 1972. During their career, the group has released 14 studio albums and their career sales total over 25 million records sold, including 10 million records sold in 1970 alone. \n\nThe band split in 1977 and reunited in 1980, splitting again in 1983. Since reuniting in 1996 they have remained active, although Farner left the band in 1999. The group currently consists of Max Carl (vocals), Bruce Kulick (guitar), Mel Schacher (bass), Tim Cashion (keyboards), and Don Brewer (drums, vocals).\n\nDespite their name, their music is far from the style known as \"funk\"; the name \"Grand Funk Railroad\" is a play on Michigan's \"Grand Trunk Western Railroad\" line, and it was chosen before \"funk\" had become the name of a music genre. In 1968, suburban Michigan teens Don Brewer and Mark Farner quit Terry Knight and The Pack and recruited ? and The Mysterians bass player Mel Schacher to form a power trio inspired by contemporary rock n roll.\n\nEarly in their career, they headlined a much hyped free concert in Hyde Park, wowing the audience whilst being virtually unknown in the U.K.  They also opened for Led Zeppelin in Michigan, their home state. Originally produced and managed by former band leader Terry Knight who brought the group to Capitol records in 1969, they split from Knight in 1972 after money issues left the group nearly bankrupt despite massive commercial success which began after an successful appearance at the Atlanta Pop Festival.\n\nAfter releasing 12 albums on Capitol (10 platinum), they intend for their final release to be Born To Die in 1975. They actually reunited & recorded one last effort in 1976 with Frank Zappa called \"Good Singin' Good Playin' \" and then called it quits.\n\nFarner released two solo albums, Mel & Don recorded as Flint with Craig before Craig joined [aritst]Bob Seger's band. In 1981 Mark Farner & Don reformed the band without Mel and released a song on the animated Heavy Metal soundtrack and new album Grand Funk Lives. They toured until 1983.\n\nIn 1996 all three original members reunited for a summer tour in which they played to over 250,000 people, and a slate of Bosnian relief dates in 1997 including several TV performances. In 1998 they did a 65+ date tour listed as one of the 10 top grossing tours of the year. In 1999 Capitol issued a 3 disc box set called \"Thirty Years Of Funk\" 1969-1999, including recent recordings made in 1997.\n\nOriginal Grand Funk Railroad members Don & Mel still tour and write new material to this day although the group have seen various line up changes, including the absence of original lead singer Mark Farner.  Mark is active with his New band Nr'G. They have released 3 CD's since 1999 with For The People released in 2006.\n\nStudio Albums:\n    * On Time  (1969)\n    * Grand Funk (The Red Album)  (1969)\n    * Closer to Home  (1970)\n    * Survival  (1971)\n    * E Pluribus Funk  (1971)\n    * Phoenix  (1972)\n    * We're an American Band  (1973)\n    * Shinin' On  (1974)\n    * Monumental Funk  (1974)\n    * All the Girls in the World Beware!!!
