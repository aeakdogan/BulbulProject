On \"Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free),\" he spits rhymes about aspects of modern American life he doesn’t like such as \"Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models, with cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils” as well as socio-political problems in Ghana and the invasion of Iraq.\n\nLupe released his fifth studio album \"Tetsuo & Youth\" on January 20, 2015.\n\nLupe has previously been on label Epic with his group Da Pak and then signed a solo deal with Arista.
