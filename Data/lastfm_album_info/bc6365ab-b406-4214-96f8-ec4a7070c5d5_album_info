In Japan it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on Saturday Night Live playing \"Juicebox\" and \"You Only Live Once\".\nThe album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne. Despite its initial strong sales, First Impressions of Earth received the worst reception, both commercially and critically, of all their three albums.\nIn 2006, the band played 18 sold-out shows during their UK tour. In February 2006, The Strokes won \"Best International Band\" at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the US with their longest tour yet. The second single off First Impressions of Earth, \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/First+Impressions+of+Earth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
