Meanwhile, it reached #4 in the US with an entry sales week of 89,000 units, 1,000 more than that of its predecessor, First Impressions of Earth.\n\nInspired, in part, by bands like Arctic Monkeys, and Crystal Castles, The Strokes decided to experiment with various production techniques including MIDI electronic samples and Farfisa keyboards. They also overdubbed more guitars, and Casablancas toyed with vocal layers. Bassist Nikolai Fraiture revealed that the album would be \"a return to the basics\", suggesting the songs would be of similar style to their acclaimed 2001 debut record, Is This It. \"Sonically, I feel it's the album which should have been made between Room on Fire and First Impressions of Earth,\" he stated. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/Angles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
