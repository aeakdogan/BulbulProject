On some early presses of the album, instrumental versions of \"Guns Blazing\" and \"The Knock\" were added as tracks 13 & 14. On some re-releases of this album, \"Be There\" was added as track 13. Some versions (mainly the Japanese release, but also the US promotional copy) contain the hidden track \"Intro (optional)\" as \"track zero\", which is actually the pre-gap (index 0) of track 1. This can be accessed by \"rewinding\" the first track on some CD players.\n\n\"Lonely Soul\" was featured in an Assassin's Creed trailer for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. It was also featured on the soundtrack to the film The Beach. Psyence Fiction debuted at #15 in Australia.
