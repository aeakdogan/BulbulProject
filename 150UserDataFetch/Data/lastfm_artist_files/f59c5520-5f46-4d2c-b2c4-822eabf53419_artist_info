Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Its following studio album, Meteora, continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth greatest band of the music video era and the third best of the new millennium behind Oasis and Coldplay.\n\nHaving adapted the nu metal and rap metal genres to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight, which was released in 2007. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third best debut week of any album that year. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others included on Reanimation. The band's most recent studio album, A Thousand Suns, was released on September 8, 2010. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.\n\nCharity:\nOn January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled Not Alone as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called Download to Donate for Haiti in support of the Haiti Earthquake crisis. On February 10, 2010, Linkin Park released the official music video for the song on their homepage. The single itself was released on October 21, 2011.\n\nOn January 11, 2011, an updated version of Download to Donate for Haiti was launched, called Download to Donate for Haiti V2.0, with more songs to download. For the updated compilation, the band released Keaton Hashimoto's remix of The Catalyst from the \"Linkin Park featuring YOU\" contest.\n\nShinoda designed two t-shirts, in which the proceeds will go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters. Music For Relief released Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan, another compilation of songs, in which the proceeds will go to Save the Children. The band released the song titled as Issho Ni, meaning \"we're in this together\", on March 22, 2011 via Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan.\n\nIn the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the \"Music for Relief: Concert For the Philippines\" in Los Angeles, California, and raised donations for victims. The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February 15. Other artists during the tour included The Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, and The Filharmonic.\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.linkinpark.com/main\n\nGenres: Alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock\n\nCurrent members:\nChester Bennington – vocals (since 1999)\nRob Bourdon – drums, percussion (since 1996)\nBrad Delson – lead guitar (since 1996)\nDave Farrell – bass (1996–1998, 1999, since 2001)\nJoe \"Mr. Hahn\" Hahn – turntables, programming, samples (since 1996)\nMike Shinoda – vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard (since 1996).\n\nFormer members:\n\nMark Wakefield - vocals (1996–1998)\nKyle Christener - bass (1999)\nScott Koziol - bass (2000–2001).\n\nDiscography:\n\nAlbums:\n1.
