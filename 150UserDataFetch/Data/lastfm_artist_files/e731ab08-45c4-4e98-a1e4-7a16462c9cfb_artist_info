WhoMadeWho's sound has been described as \"lean, yet lush and moving crisply through continents of stylistic territory.\" Besides a number of 12\" singles and remixes for other artists, the band's first full release was their self-titled debut, 'WhoMadeWho'. The majority of the tracks from this album were later reworked into acoustic form on what would become their second record, 'Green Versions'. The band notably covered the popular Benny Benassi song \"Satisfaction\" on their first album and subsequent live performances. WhoMadeWho's track \"Space For Rent\" was performed live by Queens of the Stone Age member Josh Homme's side-project, the Fififf Teeners in their only live performance to date, a fact the band acknowledge on their MySpace. WhoMadeWho gained further popularity when they headlined the Benicàssim festival in 2007 after a delay caused former headliners, the Klaxons, to arrive too late to play their set. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/WhoMadeWho\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
