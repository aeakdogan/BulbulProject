It features on their debut album Definitely Maybe, on the \"Whatever\" single, On the Champagne Supernova single and on their best-of album, Stop the Clocks.\nArguably the first Oasis love song, Noel wrote it about an imaginary teenage love affair. Both of the Gallagher brothers claim that the song should be played more often at concerts, and although it is rarely played, it remains a fan favourite. However, it was included on the set list of the band's recent Dig Out Your Soul Tour. Described by current Oasis guitarist Gem Archer as, \"the one for the fans\", the song is considered by many to be the epitome of Oasis as a brash, flowing song that contains some of Noel's finest penned lyrics as well as Liam's most intense vocal.\nDuring the recording of Definitely Maybe, there was an argument between Noel Gallagher and rhythm guitarist Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs. Gallagher was taken to the pub by bassist Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan where he calmed down, had a few drinks, went back to the studios and recorded \"Slide Away\". Gallagher claims he wrote it on a Les Paul guitar that Johnny Marr sent to him, since he had few guitars available to him at the time. On the Definitely Maybe DVD, he also notes that he took Marr's guitar out of the case, sat down, and \"the song wrote itself\".\nPaul McCartney of The Beatles has said that this is his favorite Oasis track.\nIn an interview on the bonus DVD of Stop The Clocks, Noel comments that this track contains Liam's best ever singing. Also in the interview, Noel claimed that he was told to release it as a fifth single from Definitely Maybe, but Gallagher refused because it would be ridiculous to have five singles from a debut album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Slide+Away\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
