In addition, the song heavily samples the 1986 hit \"The Way It Is\" by Bruce Hornsby and the Range.\n\nThe Chris Hafner-directed music video is a compilation of a number of previous music videos 2Pac released in addition to home videos and never-before-seen pictures.\n\n\"Changes\" was nominated for Best Rap Solo Performance at the Grammy Awards of 2000; it remains the only posthumous song to be nominated in this category. One verse in \"Changes\" was first featured in his previous release \"I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto\". There is also a notable remix of the song mashed up with Nelly Furtado's \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\". The \"Huey\" that 2Pac mentions in the song (\"two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead\") is Black Panther Party activist Huey P. Newton. In 2008, Changes climbed to Number One on Billboard magazine's Hot Ringtones chart. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/2Pac/_/Changes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
