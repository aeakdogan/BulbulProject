The band's \"signature debut hit\" features lyrics which seem to represent the thoughts of a serial killer. Allmusic calls it a \"deceptively funky New Wave/No Wave song ... [with] an insistent rhythm, and one of the most memorable, driving bass lines in rock & roll.\"\n\n\"Psycho Killer\" was the only song from the album to appear on the Billboard charts, peaking at 92 among Billboard Pop Singles. It placed 32nd on the Triple J Hottest 100 in 1989. It almost made the top ten in the Netherlands, peaking at #11 in 1977.\n\nLyrics\n\nAccording to the preliminary lyric sheets copied onto the 2006 remaster of Talking Heads: 77, the song started off as a semi-narrative of the killer actually committing murders. Byrne has said of the song:\nWhen I started writing this (I got help later), I imagined Alice Cooper doing a Randy Newman-type ballad. Both the Joker and Hannibal Lecter were much more fascinating than the good guys. Everybody sort of roots for the bad guys in movies.\nThe bridge lyrics are in French and include the prominent chorus line, \"Qu'est-ce que c'est ?\", which translates in English to \"What is it?\". The rest of the French lyrics are:\nCe que j'ai fait ce soir-là\nCe qu'elle a dit ce soir-là'\nRéalisant mon espoir\nJe me lance vers la gloire... OK\nWhat I did, that evening\nWhat she said, that evening\nFulfilling my hope\nHeadlong I go for glory... OK\n\nAn early demo version of the song, recorded at CBS Studios, and also performed at CBGB had different lyrics after the first chorus:\nListen to me, now I’ve passed the test\nI think I’m cute, I think I’m the best\nSkirt tight, don't like that style\nDon’t criticize what I know is worthwhile\nLater releases\n\nA live version was released on The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads in 1982. Two years later, another live version was included on the soundtrack for Stop Making Sense, the band's 1984 concert movie. The film opens with Byrne alone onstage, announcing \"'Hi. I've got tape I want to play'...[and] strumming maniacally like Richie Havens\", playing an acoustic version of \"Psycho Killer\", backed only by a Roland TR-808 drum machine whose sound appears to be issuing from a boom box. The drum machine \"fires\" machine gun riffs that causes Byrne to stagger \"like Jean Paul Belmondo in the final minutes of 'Breathless,' a hero succumbing, surprised, to violence that he'd thought he was prepared for.\"\n\nThe song also appears on their 1992 compilation album Sand in the Vaseline: Popular Favorites and over a decade later on another compilation album, The Best of Talking Heads.\n\nThe game Rock Band 2 features \"Psycho Killer\"\n\nThe film Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon features \"Psycho Killer\" over its end credits. The Simpsons' \"Treehouse of Horror XIX\" features the song as Homer goes on a killing spree. \"Psycho Killer\" was playing in the background at the diner scene in the Spike Lee film Summer of Sam.\n\nThe song appeared in the \"Building 26\" episode of Heroes when Sylar turns on the radio. The character is in fact, a psycho killer.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Talking+Heads/_/Psycho+Killer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
