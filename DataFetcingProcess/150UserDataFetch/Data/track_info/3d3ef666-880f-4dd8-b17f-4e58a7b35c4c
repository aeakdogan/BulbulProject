But I liked the West (Indies) influence that the music had. I just went in the booth and they were already jotting down some ideas and that (the hook) came to me. The hook \"rude boy\" was just supposed to be the intro. But it was so catchy we that we just made it the hook. \"\n\nRihanna has also told Q magazine the song is \"about the kind of street, bad boy that girls sometimes like.\"\n\nThe video was directed by music video director Melina Matsoukas in January 2010 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California and was shot in a greenscreen. Matsoukas previously directed Rihanna's \"Hard\" music video. Rihanna said that the video is completely different from any other video she's shot before, describing it as \"pretty freakin' cool\". She added: \"A lot of my videos are really dark and edgy and tough. 'Rude Boy' is more playing along the lines from my roots. We used a lot of color, but also the costumes were very Jamaican dance-hall queen type\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/_/Rude+Boy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
