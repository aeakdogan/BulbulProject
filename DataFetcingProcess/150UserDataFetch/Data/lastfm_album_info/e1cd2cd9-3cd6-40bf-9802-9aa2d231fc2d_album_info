The album was primarily recorded in Paris, with West enlisting various artists and close collaborators for work and production on the album. West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin a mere week shy of its release to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach.\n\nMusically, Yeezus is darker and sonically experimental, combining elements of Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Promotion of Yeezus included worldwide video projections of the music and live television performances. The album received rave reviews from music critics upon its release. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Yeezus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
