We obviously couldn't help noticing that the record has leaked early and that some of you have already heard it.\n\nWe're happy to hear everybody is enjoying the tracks. Obviously, we would have preferred it not to get out so early (every act likes to be able to present their music in the desired fashion as i'm sure you all appreciate) but we're glad that it's being so well received.\n\nWe know some people download music as they can't afford to buy every CD they'd like to own (these are tough economic times after all) and we're not mad at you if that is the case, it doesn't make you any less important to us. We genuinely value all the support you give us and would rather you downloaded it for free than didn't listen at all.\n\nIf you do download it from P2P and enjoy it then check out the deluxe edition when it is released properly. We're going to load it up with special additional content to try to make it real value for money, it should make for a nice little package for those of you that like to have something physical. Hopefully there will be some nice extra tracks and a dvd to accompany the record.\n\nWe're also working on a nice super ltd edition package which we will be selling for a short time via our new webshop.\n\nOne thing we did want to point out is that the version that has leaked is not a finished mastered version and contains slightly different versions of several tracks to the ones which will be on the final album.\n\nThe audio quality will also be much improved by the mastering process.\n\nIt's a shame as the band really wanted to make sure everybody heard the final, fully realised version of the record but in the event that you do listen to the leaked version please bear this in mind.\n\nThat's it for now. Have a great weekend. More festivals and shows to be announced in the near future.\n\nBest,\n\nSimon  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Phoenix/Wolfgang+Amadeus+Phoenix\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
